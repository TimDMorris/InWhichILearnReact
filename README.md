## Stuff I'm thinking about

The notes below are primarily for me to keep track of what I'm thinking about, but as I'm a big fan of <em>knowledge in the world, not knowledge in the head</em>, I thought I should share them with the world here.

### Styling and Theming

I'm learning React to build Enterprise scalable web applications. There's a lot of cool technologies I want to use but I have concerns about anything that is going to add a marginal performance hit that could then scale up to be a noticeable performance hit as I scale up apps.

So while having come from an Angular Background the mental model of Styled Components is pretty appealing to me, with some qualifiers:

- [A Lukewarm Approval of CSS-in-JS](https://sparkbox.com/foundry/css_in_js_overview_css_in_js_pros_and_cons)

I'm a little concerned about the potential performance hit:

- [Real-world CSS vs. CSS-in-JS performance comparison](https://pustelto.com/blog/css-vs-css-in-js-perf/)

Now while there are some really promising looking strategies to address this:

- [CSS-in-JS Performance Cost - Mitigating Strategies](https://www.infoq.com/news/2020/01/css-cssinjs-performance-cost/)
- [How to increase CSS-in-JS performance by 175x](https://itnext.io/how-to-increase-css-in-js-performance-by-175x-f30ddeac6bce)

For the time being I have a lot of other React stuff to be thinking about so I'm going to stick with nice straightforward [BEM based styling](http://getbem.com/introduction/) and worry about potentially refactoring it to something smarter later. For more on BEM [check out this piece on why BEM](https://blog.decaf.de/2015/06/24/why-bem-in-a-nutshell/) and if it's interesting to you there's more [here under getting your head around BEM syntax](https://csswizardry.com/2013/01/mindbemding-getting-your-head-round-bem-syntax/).

I'm also thinking that if I want to build to scale then I don't necessarily want to be builfing everything from the ground up, so on my list of other things to look at are:

- [How to Use Tailwind With BEM](https://www.wearecogworks.com/blog/how-to-use-tailwind-with-bem/)
- [Tailwind CSS and BEM](https://codeblog.trovster.com/2020/04/tailwind-and-bem/)
